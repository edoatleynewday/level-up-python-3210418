# Python Code Challenge #1: Find Prime Factors

Your goal is to implement a function, `get_prime_factors()`, that takes an integer value as the input argument and returns a list containing all of its prime factors.

## Example Test Output
```console
>>> get_prime_factors(630)
[2, 3, 3, 5, 7]
```

##Â Thoughts

- Interestingly the model answer does not even care about whether the number is prime
- The first 42 lines of my code deal with primes!
- I think I got carried away with the prime functionality and should have tackled the easier parts first
